#CyCLaDEs: A Decentralized Cache for Linked Data Fragments

CyCLaDEs is an overlay network based on LDF fragments similarity. For each LDF client, 
CyCLaDEs builds a neighborhood of LDF
clients hosting related fragments in their cache. During query processing,
neighborhood cache is checked before requesting LDF server.
